ODI Engineering GitHub Project Template

For all our projects, we need some basic information and organization for working in a shared environment. This template is a guide to the kind of information we need to keep track of so that we can onboard others as needed & PMs can more easily follow our evolving work.

## Where does a filled out project template live?

Still figuring this out, current options are:
* In odi-engineering GitHub repo wiki
* In project GitHub repo, in a file called PROJECT.md
* In an ODI Google Drive for the project, in a project file
* In channel intro of appropriate project Slack channel 
* In odi-engineering Airtable in a table called Projects
